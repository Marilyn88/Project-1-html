<p>Hi there everyone!  My name is <u>Jon Arbuckle</u>.  I am 30 years old and I am a cartoonist that live in Muncie, Indiana.  I am the proud owner of a cat anmes Garfield and a dog names Odie.  Garfiled is a fat, lazy and loves to eat, while Odie is a dog without a brain.  Although my pets dirve me crazy, I can't image life without them.
<p>I spend about half my time going to the grocery store to buy enough food to feed Garfield.  I have to make sure to buy all of Garfiled's gavorite foods, or else he'll get grumpy.  This includes milk, cheese, bread, ham, chicken wings, potato chips, pasta with marinara sauce, frozen pizzas, and <b>lots and lots</b> of lasanga.  When I come home, Garfield usually attacks me and tries to eat everything inthe grocery bag before I even have time to put it in the refrigerator.  One time he ate everything that I bought in 30 seconds, and I had to go back to the store to buy more food.  <i>I wasn't too happy about that</i></p>
